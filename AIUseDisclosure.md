# AI Tools Used in This Project

We leveraged AI tools to assist us with the following tasks:

1. **Selecting the Best Chunking and Embeddings:**  
   AI assisted us in determining the best chunking techniques and embeddings for our data using NVIDIA data.

2. **Learning About the Pinecone Vector Database:**  
   To better comprehend the Pinecone vector database and its role in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we applied artificial intelligence (AI).

3. **Comparing Pinecone and Chromadb:**  
   In order to help us make better judgments, AI was also utilized to examine the main distinctions between Pinecone and Chromadb.
